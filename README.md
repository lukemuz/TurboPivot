# TurboPivot

**This repo is an experiment to test the state of "vibe-coding".  Every line of code in this repo has been written by an LLM**

TurboPivot uses a polars/rust backend and a react frontend to create a pivot-table like experience with incredible speed. 

It's not fully featured, but it's impressive given that it was fully written by Claude 3.7 Sonnet via Cursor!
